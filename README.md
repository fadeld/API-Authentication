# API Authentication Samples
Here are examples of API authentication in Swift (OS X and iOS) and Java, for LinkedIn, Facebook, meetup.com, Yammer, Amazon, Paypal, FourSquare, Salesforce, AOL, Battle.net, Twitch and Uber. 

The purpose of the project is to show a simple working implementation of API authentication using web server authentication flow of OAuth2. The examples do not handle exceptions, to keep the code clear and readable. 

The UI in Swift is created programmatically, without Interface Builder.

IDE details and some FAQ are on the wiki page.
