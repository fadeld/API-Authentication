# API Authentication 
Here are examples of API authentication in Swift and Java. 

The Swift sample apps were implmented on IntelliJ AppCode 3.1 IDE. The UI is created programmatically, without Interface Builder. The Java sample apps were implmented on IntelliJ IDEA 14 IDE. 

I do not have the time to support this project, but I can provide consulting hours or develop authentication for your API upon request (upfront payments).
