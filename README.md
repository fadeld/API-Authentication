# API Authentication 
Here are examples of API authentication in Swift and Java. 

I would be happy to develop API authentication examples upon request. 

The Swift sample apps were implmented in IntelliJ AppCode 3.1 IDE. The UI is created programmatically, without Interface Builder. 

The Java sample apps were implmented in IntelliJ IDEA 14 IDE.
