# API Authentication Samples
Here are examples of API authentication in Swift (OS X and iOS) and Java, for LinkedIn, Facebook, meetup.com, Yammer, Amazon, Paypal, FourSquare, Salesforce, AOL, Battle.net, Twitch and Uber. 

The purpose of the project is to show a simple working implementation of API authentication using web server authentication flow. The examples do not handle exceptions, to keep the code clear and readable. 

IDE details are on the wiki page. 

I hope this would be useful.
